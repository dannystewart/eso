Faster Travel adds two new tabs to the default world map information/navigation control and suggests approximately the closest known wayshrines to your current quest objectives.
Adds favourite wayshrines!
Also supports Cyrodiil campaigns and Transitus Wayshrines including queuing, entering, travelling and tooltip display!

Mandatory dependencies:
	LibWorldMapInfoTab
	LibAddonMenu-2.0
	LibSavedVars
Optional dependencies:
	LibZone

WAYSHRINES TAB
Marks the closest known wayshrine to your quests with the quest's icon from the map (when it is possible to obtain the data).
Displays quest objective tooltips when the mouse is over quest icons.
Numbers in magenta denote how many guild traders are close to every wayshrine.
Lets you fast travel to:
- a recently used wayshrine
- a favourite wayshrine
- a wayshrine in the current zone
- a wayshrine in another zone
- a wayshrine from an alphabetically sorted list
(normal costs apply to all the above, if you're not travelling from another wayshrine)
- a random wayshrine on the current map.
Right-click on wayshrines in this menu to add or remove favourites.

PLAYERS TAB
Lets you easily teleport (for free) to:
- players in your group
- players on your friends list
- zones using players on your friends list, in your group or guild
- players in any of your guilds
(you land at the wayshrine closest to your friend/guildmate's position).
Zones where you have survey or treasure maps are prefixed with green + or yellow *
and suffixed with the number of treasure map (in yellow) and survey (in green) locations
for maps you have in inventory (please note: locations, not maps, so if you have three surveys
pointing to the same location, the number is 1, not 3).

SLASH COMMANDS
/ft zoneName - attempts to teleport to a zone via a player (zoneName can be partial)
/ft zone - if zoneName is literally "zone", use current zone name
/ft @PlayerName - attempts to teleport to a player
/ft CharacterName - attempts to teleport a player using their character name
/ft group - attempts to teleport to the group leader (or a random member of your group if you are the leader)
/ft UnitTag - attempts to teleport to a group member using their unit tag (group1, group2 etc.)

For all of the above you can use /goto instead of /ft (for backward compatibility).

/ft alias name zonename - defines an alias "name" pointing to "zonename", so that if you use:
/ft alias fen Shadowfen
you can then go to Shadowfen with "/ft fen"
/ft alias name - removes a previously defined alias "name"
/ft alias - lists defined aliases
/ft verbosity n - sets verbosity level to n, where:
n = 0 - quiet (almost no messages in chat)
n = 1 - normal verbosity level (default)
n = 2 - a bit more verbose
n > 2 - for debugging only
/ft verbosity - shows verbosity level
/ft recents on|off - turns on/off your "Recent" list
/ft listlen n - sets the max length of "Recent" list to n, where 0<n<100 (default value is 10)
/ft listlen - shows the max length of "Recent" list

    https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1399-VotansMinimap.html#comments

Version 2.2.6 (by SimonIllyan 2019-04-24)
    - Fixed a bug where player teleported to a location that has a zone name as a substring rather than to the zone proper
      (for example, to Coldharbour Surreal Estate instead of Coldharbour)
    - /f5housing command renamed to /recents, since housing preview works whether this option is set or not -
      what changes is the availability of the "recent" location list
    - minor bugfixes and changes to predefined zone aliases

Version 2.2.5 (by SimonIllyan 2019-03-17)
    - Updated for API 100026 (Wrathstone)

Version 2.2.3 (by SimonIllyan 2018-09-02)
    - /f5housing on|off now reloads UI by itself

    - Fixed sorting of zone names beginning with "The" ("The" should be ignored)

Version 2.2.1 (by SimonIllyan 2018-08-20)
    - Fixed alliance icons in Wayshrines tab
    - "/agoto" output is now sorted by value
    - When /f5housing is set to off, recents list is not being updated;
      as an interim solution it is hidden from view as well.

Version 2.2.0 (by SimonIllyan 2018-08-19)
    - /agoto without arguments now lists existing aliases, "/agoto key" removes an alias for "key"
    - Added predefined aliases for ambiguous zone names
    - Added "/f5housing on|off" command to dynamically enable/disable WfD's fix for house preview.
      This fix, unfortunately, has a side effect - cancelling a teleport must be done TWICE.
      Some people find it annoying, so now it is possible to switch it off and on;
      "/reloadui" is REQUIRED afterwards.
